# JDA Examples Root

This is the parent of all JDA example projects. Each example is created as a module subproject.

The `modules` element of the `pom.xml` file (shown below) lists all the examples:

```
<modules>
    <module>courseman</module>
</modules>
```

# Example: CourseMan (root)
This is the root project of the series of CourseMan examples. We use CourseMan (Course Management) as an example to demonstrate JDA. Each examples demonstrates a subset of the JDA features.

Refer to the [`courseman/ReadMe.md`](courseman/ReadMe.md) file, under the CourseMan example project for details.
