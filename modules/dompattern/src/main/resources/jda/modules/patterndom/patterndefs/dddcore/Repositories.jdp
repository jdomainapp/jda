/**
 * @overview Pattern: REPOSITORIES
 * 
 * <p>
 * This pattern is both an adaption and a generalisation of the
 * object-relational mapping solution. First, it is an adaption in the
 * sense of taking the object-relational mapping and applying it to the domain
 * model. In particular, it handles how an entity is stored in an underlying
 * database and how to manage access to this database. Second, the pattern
 * generalises the mapping in that it defines an abstraction layer on top of the
 * underlying database and a set of generic operations for querying the
 * entities. The abstraction takes the form of a repository â€“ a space where the
 * entities "live" and can be searched for.
