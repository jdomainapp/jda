Example: `jda-eg-coursemanmsa`
===============================

A version of the `CourseMan` software that demonstrates the state-of-the-art MSA technologies.

It extends a previous version (`jda-eg-coursemanmosar`) to use MSA instead of the the RESTFUL API.

# Requirements

## Domain model
The domain model is based on that of the example project `jda-eg-coursemanmosar`.

The domain model is **fragmented** into one or more submodels based on the bounded contexts. The following subsections describe some **use cases** of domain model fragmentation that are supported by the software. Some use cases include **extensions** of the domain model to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the domain requirements.

### Use case 1: No extensions

| Submodels | Modules | |
| :--: | :--: |  :--: |
| Address Administration | Address | 
| Student Registration | Student | uses Address 
| Class Registration | StudentClass | uses Student
| Academic Administration | Enrolment | uses Student, Course Module
| Course Administration | CourseModule, CompulsoryModule, ElectiveModule  | 

### Use case 2: Academic and payment extensions

| Submodels | Modules | Extensions 
| :--: | :--: | :--: | 
|Address Administration | Address | 
| Student Registration | Student | 
| Class Registration | StudentClass |
| Enrolment Administration | Enrolment | only with student and course module details
| Academic Administration | Enrolment | with mark and grade details
| Course Administration | CourseModule, CompulsoryModule, ElectiveModule |  CourseModule has a unit fee
| Finance Administration | CoursePayment | Payment for course module enrolment, computed from the unit fees of the enrolled CourseModules

## Architecture

The core requirement is that this software must be **architectured based on MSA**. It consists of as many **microservices** as necessary to address the submodels.
Each service autonomously operates on a submodel of the domain model.

1. There must be at least one microservice that manages one submodel
2. Each service is based on and extends the functionality of a `CourseMan` **software module** in the `jda-eg-coursemanmosar` software. In this version, only the backend functionality needs to be considered.
3. Each service is realised by a **SpringBoot** application
4. Services communicate via **Kafka**'s event streaming (see `jda-eg-coursemankafka` for how to achieve this)
5. Standard **logging** must be used to log each service's action
6. Additional layers/APIs can and should be added on top of Kafka to help more effectively manage the data exchange between services
